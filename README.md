this project serves as a lab to revisit my node skills.

run `npm i` to install dependencies.

`npm run server` to run app with nodemon or

`npm start`

for testing socket-client with socket server.
    you need 2 terminal winows, one for the server and one to server the client.
    run `npm start` to start the server.
    run `npm start socket-client` to start the server.
